# AlignmentReporter
A tool for DM to easily make Alignment Change Graphs for their Campaigns, with a save system to switch between parties.
Originally just a part of a larger toolbox, I am currently making it a standalone project. It is a bit old and need some changes (mainly using postprocesses and such).

The tool is quite simple in its way but I will add a tutorial later. For now simply launch The __init__.py at the root directory and enter a save file name. It will automatically load any existing file in the data folder if it exists. I have already created two save files from personnal games (accessible with the names"Celtaidd" and "Volac").

The generated images are in the "out" directory but a preview is loaded in the tool
